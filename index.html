<h1>Hi there ! I'm Jawad</h1>
<p><img src="profil.jpg" alt="(Please don't blame me for not having a profile)" height="120" width="120"></p>

<p>I am 20, student at HEC Paris and starting to fall in love with a <em>Sublime</em> lady whose last name is <em>Text...</em></p>

<h1>Basketball</h1>
<p>I play at a national level since I am 16 years old. My all time favourite player is Dennis Rodman for his <em>consensual</em> and <em>discreet</em> behavior...</p>

<h1>Litterature and poetry</h1>
<p>I keep it rather simple : <strong>Victor Hugo</strong>, <strong>Byron</strong> and <strong>Rimbaud</strong>. However, in eternal matters, simpler is usually better. </p>

<h1>Music</h1>
<p>I rather play <strong>cello</strong> in my room than pointlessly scroll on social media. That's maybe why I don't have any social media page to display, which I will replace by presenting to you my current favourite music</p>


<h4>As promised, here is my favourite music</h4>
